   | The sum of the squares of the first ten natural  |
   | numbers is 385.                                  |
   | The square of the sum of the first ten natural   |
   | numbers is 3025.                                 |
   |                                                  |
   | Hence the difference between the sum of the      |
   | squares of the first ten natural numbers and     |
   | the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.      |
   |                                                  |
   | Find the difference between the sum of the       |
   | squares of the first one hundred natural         |
   | numbers and the square of the sum.               |
